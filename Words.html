      A Collection of My Deepest Feelings for You
    </h3>
    <br />
    <pr>
      I’ve been feeling lost for a long time. I thought I wouldn’t be able to
      receive true, unconditional love for the rest of my life. But I found you.
      I always remember the first day I met you. I remember everything in
      detail,your smell, what you wore, how you smiled at me. I love you with my
      whole heart. I love everything about you. If I have to say it in detail,
      it will be your pure heart. Whenever you speak to me, I melt. I love you
      today more than yesterday, and I will love you even more tomorrow. I truly
      appreciate your kindness, your effort, your love, your compassion toward
      me, and everything you have done for me. I want to keep this memory
      forever. I promise you that I will love and support you forever. I will be
      by your side in your ups and downs. You belong to me. I love you, my
      sweetest boy.
